# **What Are Workspaces?**

Workspaces in Power BI are collaborative environments where you can create, publish, manage, and share Power BI content. They are essential for organizing content, enabling collaboration, managing permissions, and distributing reports/dashboards to users.

## Power BI has **two main Workspace types**:

# 1. My Workspace

### **Definition**
- Your personal workspace (one per user).
- Only **you** can access it.
### **Key Characteristics**
- **Personal/non-collaborative space**: Not meant for team or enterprise reporting.
- **Content types allowed**: datasets, reports, dashboards, workbooks.
- **Sharing**:
    - You **can share** report/dashboard from My Workspace with others (Pro → Pro).
    - But others **cannot edit** your content.
    - No co-authoring features.
- **Not suitable for production deployment.**
- **No Dataflows**, **no Pipelines**, **no shared ownership**.
### **Use Cases**
- Learning, exploration, prototyping, personal projects.
- Temporary workspace before moving content to a shared workspace.

### **PL-300 Exam Tips**
- _My Workspace cannot be used for collaboration._
- _It is not supported in Deployment Pipelines._
- _You cannot assign workspace roles in My Workspace._
- _Only one user can access the content._

# 2. Workspaces (Shared Workspaces)

### **Definition**
- Collaborative, team-based workspaces that allow multiple users to build and manage Power BI content.
### **Key Characteristics**
- Supports **collaboration between multiple users**.
- Requires **Power BI Pro, PPU, or Fabric license**.
- Content is accessible to everyone assigned to the workspace.
- **Up to 500 members** per workspace.
    
- Supports:
    - Dataflows
    - Datamarts
    - Pipelines
    - Apps
    - Shared Datasets
    - Endorsements & Sensitivity labels
