# why do we need visuals?
- we can't find patterns when data is in tables and it is impossible if the data is too big, so using visuals (charts) will help find patterns which are hidden in the tabular format.

# From “why” to “how”:
After showing _why_ visualization is powerful, the book now explains _how_ we actually build visualizations. Two key foundations:
1. **Preattentive attributes** (what the brain notices instantly).
2. **Types of data** (what kind of data we’re showing).

### **Preattentive attributes**:
- When we visualize, we transform data into **marks on a canvas** (bars, dots, lines, colors, etc.).
- Our brains are wired to notice certain features _immediately_, within milliseconds, before we consciously think.
- These features are called **preattentive attributes**.

**Example with numbers**:
- A grid of numbers (e.g., lots of digits including 9s).
- Task: “How many 9s are there?” → It’s slow if all numbers look the same.
- If we make 9s **red** and others gray → instantly obvious.
- Even in a grid of thousands of numbers, the red one pops out right away.
